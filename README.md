# spim8

I try to keep a "classic" version of James Larus' excellent SPIM simulator
alive here.
You probably want [the current version](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/)
instead.

## goals and non-goals

Achieved:

- roughly the core feature set of SPIM 8.0 (doh!)

Planned:

- clean-ish, modern-ish code-base
- focus on console, forget about X
- basic profiling to compare student code

## branches

The [master](https://github.com/phf/spim8/tree/master) branch is for daily
development work and pull requests; keep 'em coming!

The [pristine](https://github.com/phf/spim8/tree/pristine) branch has the
original SPIM 8.0 distribution I started from; nothing should ever change
there.

If there is ever an actual release, it will live on its own branch; if there
is ever a big-enough feature to develop, it will live on its own branch.
